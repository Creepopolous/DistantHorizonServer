splash.0=Yisheng is known for the advanced biological research which takes place onworld. Who knows what you could find just wandering around the station?
splash.1=You've heard that a lot of unethical human experimentation happens on Yisheng. You remember this as you sample the bio-engineered food on your plate.
splash.2=Today you ordered a local delicacy, four-dimensional beef. It grows larger as it sits on your plate. You eat it quickly before it flits back out of existence.
