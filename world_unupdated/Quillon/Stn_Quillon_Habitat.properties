displayName=Quillon Habitat - Hollow Asteroid
splash.0=Due to a lack of habitable planets in the Quillon system, this hollowed asteroid is the center of human civilization here.
splash.1=All aspects of life here are rigidly controlled by the QUI-EM corporation. Nevertheless, you've heard rumors of an underground movement here.
splash.2=*ding* QUI-EM corporation welcomes you to Quillon Habitat! Please proceed directly to the decontamination room for your mandatory cleansing. *ding*
splash.3=Your normal route to the market is blocked off by security. Through the smoke and sirens, you can make out outlines of bodies.
splash.4=On a window far above you, a security team is scraping off graffiti. You can just make out a couple letters: "REâ€”"
splash.5=Because Quillion Habitat is inside a hollowed asteroid, it's built much more like a city than a space station. It's jarring to look up and see skyscrapers like distant stalagtites.
splash.6=According to your 'Stowaway's Guide to the Stars', the best way to get a good drink in Quillion Habitat is to go anyhere else.
splash.7=Outside the docking station, you listen to buskers wordlessly plugging ancient tunes. An officer watches them approvingly.
splash.8=On the way to the market, you see security breaking up a vigil outside St. Thabiso's Chapel. "It's the same every time," mutters an officer. "When will they learn?"
splash.9=They say the Habitat used to have a light suspended in the middle, which provided a sun all across the inside. Then, one day, the asteroid was plunged into endless night.
splash.10=Most of the miners look at you with disgust. Some, however, have hope in their eyes. Mainly the hope that you smuggled in some RuSH.
